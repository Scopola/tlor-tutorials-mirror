TheLegendOfRandom Tutorials
===========================

This repository is meant to act as a mirror of the tutorials on
[thelegendofrandom], with all tutorials converted into markdown.

Although the website is currently still up, the owner has been
"missing in action" for 3+ years, and the tutorials have proven
very valuable for reverse engineering. This is an attempt to
preserve them in case the website ever goes offline.


Data
----

The data files provided with tutorials are a part of a separate
repository, [tlor-tutorials-data-mirror], as many of them are of
considerable size. The data repository has been included as a
submodule, and thus can be obtained via `git submodule update --init`.
