TheLegendOfRandom Tutorials
===========================

This repository is meant to act as a mirror of the tutorials on
<thelegendofrandom.com>, with all tutorials converted into markdown.

Although the website is currently still up, the owner has been
"missing in action" for 3+ years, and the tutorials have proven
very valuable for reverse engineering. This is an attempt to preserve
them in case the website ever goes offline.
