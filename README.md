TheLegendOfRandom Tutorials
===========================

This repository is meant to act as a mirror of the tutorials on
[thelegendofrandom], with all tutorials converted into markdown.

Update: The website/blog is currently down and may not come up
again, although it is still accessible from [archive.org]. The
owner has been "missing in action" for almost 3 years, and the
tutorials have proven very valuable for reverse engineering.
This is an attempt to preserve them.


Data
----

The data files provided with tutorials are a part of a separate
repository, [tlor-tutorials-data-mirror], as many of them are of
considerable size. The data repository has been included as a
submodule, and thus can be obtained via `git submodule update --init`.
